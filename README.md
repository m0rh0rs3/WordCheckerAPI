## Project Description
In each game, there is a secret word to uncover. Following each guess, a symbol sequence is displayed, consisting of +, |, or /. These symbols convey information about each character in the guess. The + symbol indicates a correct character in the right position, the | symbol signifies a correct character in the wrong position, and the / symbol denotes a character that is not present in the secret word at all.

The project is evaluated on memory efficiency and speed.
